## Grad-CAM implementation in Tensorflow
This [repo](https://github.com/cydonia999/Grad-CAM-in-TensorFlow) is a TensorFlow implementation of Gradient class activation maps(Grad-CAM[1]), 
one of visualization techniques for deep learning networks.

This repo is based on [Torch](https://github.com/ramprs/grad-cam) and [Keras](https://github.com/jacobgil/keras-grad-cam) versions of Grad-CAM.

### Requirements
* Python3.x
* Tensorflow 1.x
* [tensorflow-vgg](https://github.com/machrisaa/tensorflow-vgg) which includes the pretrained(using the Imagenet dataset) VGG16 classification model file [`VGG16.npy`](https://mega.nz/file/YU1FWJrA#O1ywiCS2IiOlUCtCpI6HTJOMrneN-Qdv3ywQP5poecM)
### Usage
 
```bash
python grad-cam-tf.py <path_to_image> <path_to_VGG16_npy> [top_n]
```
* `path_to_image`: an image for which Grad-CAM is calculated.
* `path_to_VGG16_npy`: path to the pretrained VGG16 model data provided in [`tensorflow-vgg`](https://github.com/machrisaa/tensorflow-vgg) 
* `top_n`: Optional. Grad-CAM is calculated for each 'top_n' class, which is predicted by VGG16. 

The following images are saved to the same directory as `path_to_image`:
* input image overlaid by Grad-CAM heatmap with the suffix `gradcam` appended to the `path_to_image`.
* black-and-white Grad-CAM heatmap(suffix: `heatmap`)
* segmented image by Grad-CAM heatmap(suffix: `segmented`)
* Guided Backpropagation[2] (suffix: `guided_bprop`)
* Also rank of predicted class, the class name and the probability are appended as suffix to each file names above.


### Examples

* Example image from the [original implementation](https://github.com/ramprs/grad-cam):  

the most probable class: 'boxer'(242)

The below are original image, image overlaid by Grad-CAM heatmap and segmented image by Grad-CAM heatmap.

* Image from [3]:  

the most probable class: 'desktop computer'(527)

![](examples/desk.png)
![](examples/desk_0_527_desktop_computer_0.169_gradcam.png)
![](examples/desk_0_527_desktop_computer_0.169_segmented.png)

ground truth(the second probable class): 'desk'(526)

![](examples/desk_1_526_desk_0.155_gradcam.png)
![](examples/desk_1_526_desk_0.155_segmented.png)

* Image from [fatal crash by Uber self-driving SUV](https://www.wthr.com/article/police-release-video-of-fatal-crash-by-uber-self-driving-suv):  

the most probable class: 'traffic_light'(920)

![](examples/uberfatalcrashvid970_0.jpg)
![](examples/uberfatalcrashvid970_0_0_920_traffic_light_0.105_gradcam.jpg)
![](examples/uberfatalcrashvid970_0_0_920_traffic_light_0.105_segmented.jpg)

The below are two predicted classes which are related bicycles.

the 6-th probable class: 'motor_scooter'(670)

![](examples/uberfatalcrashvid970_0_5_670_motor_scooter_0.027_gradcam.jpg)
![](examples/uberfatalcrashvid970_0_5_670_motor_scooter_0.027_segmented.jpg)

the 19-th probable class: 'moped'(665)

![](examples/uberfatalcrashvid970_0_18_665_moped_0.010_gradcam.jpg)
![](examples/uberfatalcrashvid970_0_18_665_moped_0.010_segmented.jpg)

Lines below are the top 20 classes predicted VGG16 model.
As you can see, VGG16 fails to detect bicycle related objects from this picture(though `motor_scooter` is detected with low probability).

I think Uber has built in-house classification models for self-driving cars. 
But detecting persons on roads especially at night could be difficult only by visible light. 
As reported in [Report: Uber's Self-Driving Car Sensors Ignored Cyclist In Fatal Accident](https://gizmodo.com/report-ubers-self-driving-car-sensors-ignored-cyclist-1825832504)
it seems a woman crossing the street on a bicycle was ignored.

[Detectors using an infrared camera](https://www.wired.com/story/self-driving-cars-thermal-image-cameras/) are also needed to avoid such tragic accidents.

## Note

For your information,
`Grad-CAM++`, a variant of `Grad-CAM`, is presented in [4]. The authors provided their [implementation](https://github.com/adityac94/Grad_CAM_plus_plus). 
As pointed by [Questions for computing of derivatives](https://github.com/adityac94/Grad_CAM_plus_plus/issues/1),
their implementation is weird.
